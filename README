= RBAC (Role Based Access Control) Base

This extension is used by authors of other extensions to hide those 
extensions from users based on admin defined groups. Standard Radiant
groups consist of admin, developer and users. This adds the ability
to create groups such as finance.

Installing:
Run 'rake radiant:extensions:rbac_base:migrate'

Installing the public files:
Run 'rake radiant:extensions:rbac_base:update'

To check the current users roles in your extensions simply do 
something similar to:
  current_user.roles.each do |role|
    ...perform your operations...
  end

RBAC Base adds a roles table, a roles_users table, and creates 
the has_and_belongs_to_many relationship between users and roles.

In the future we may be adding:

* A way to register extensions to prevent role deletion
* A way to automatically add roles for registered extensions
* Tests

It does not (yet) provide a way to set the :visibility of a 'tab' in the admin area of Radiant.
